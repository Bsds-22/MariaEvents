    <p><b>Most Unforgetable moments

        At this age, love can be posible to be  unforgetable, fighting with friends, achievments, bonding with family, but for me at the age of 16 , had me haunting for 5 years. Year 2017 five years ago my father died due to cardiac arrest, he was promoted to be a chief before he died. Sadly, he died in abroad, it keep me haunting because were not talking for almost 3 months because of he's not going home for 5 years, i feel so much hartred because he always say promise that he will make it, he will come home very very soon, but time and day goes by, he's not. And we fight so much that can lead me to ignore him. Stop talking to him. But god and karma had this thing. 3 months later, july 3 2017, i recieved chats from my aunt  that my father has died, that he died in his sleep. I was shocked, because im the first in our family to know that he died on that day. And thats the most unforgetable moment of my life, that in this time at the age of 21 keep haunting me.</p>
